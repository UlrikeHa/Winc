## **Assignment Superpy**
**WINC Academy**

A large supermarket chain has asked you to write a command-line tool that is able to keep track of their inventory: they want to call it **SuperPy**. The core functionality is about keeping track and producing reports on various kinds of data:

-   Which products the supermarket offers;
-   How many of each type of product the supermarket holds currently;
-   How much each product was bought for, and what its expiry date is;
-   How much each product was sold for **or** if it expired, the fact that it did;

All data must be saved in CSV files.<br>
Interaction with your program must go through the command-line. 

### Requirements

-   Use of external text files (CSV) to read and write data
-   A well-structured and user friendly command-line interface
-   Clear descriptions of each argument in the --help section
-   A text file containing a usage guide aimed with peers as the target audience
-   The usage guide should include plenty of examples
-   A short, 300-word report that highlights three technically notable elements

### The application must support:

-   Setting and advancing the date that the application perceives as ‘today’
-   Recording the buying and selling of products
-   Reporting revenue and profit over specified time periods
-   Exporting selections of data to CSV files
-   Two other additional non-trivial features of your choice
